				<h2>You are Invited!</h2>
				<center><p>The aim of this meeting is to provide a space for 
astronomers in the DC/MD/VA area, especially for senior undergraduate and graduate students, to 
present their work and facilitate networking and interaction between the
local institutions.</p></center>
				<center><p>Students are invited to submit abstracts to 
present their research in the form of both talks and posters. The format
 for presentations will be 15 minutes talks with 5 minutes for 
questions, and there will 3 sessions for viewing posters on each of the two conference days. The conference
 will be split in two days with a mix of different topics on each day. Pending people's availability, we plan to have several topical review talks 
 by senior researchers working at local institutions. When selecting contributed talks, we will give preference to 
 graduate and senior undergraduate students from a variety of institutions that represent a 
variety of fields of research. Because of the time and space limitations not every request may be accommodated.  </p></center>
