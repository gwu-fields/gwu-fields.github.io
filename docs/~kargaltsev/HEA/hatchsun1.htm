</FONT><B><P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></B></FONT>INCREASED BRIGHTNESS of the sun was forecast by Dr. George Gamow, professor of theoretical physics, in his discussion of the energy sources of stars last night before a group of government scientists and the Graduate Council of the University.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Our sun, which from the transmission of energy point of view, is only in the first half of its evolution, will get approximately 50%  times brighter in the distant future before it starts to cool,&quot; he said.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></FONT>Dr. Gamow, pioneer worker in the theoretical investigation of atomic nuclei, stated that the radiation of energy by stars and the sun in such tremendous amounts &quot;represents one of the most important and interesting problems of astrophysics.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The speaker was introduced by Prof. Lowell J. Ragatz, chairman of the program committee, with President Marvin, head of the General Council, presiding.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;The discovery of the transmutation of elements,&quot; Dr. Gamow added, &quot;further increased the problem of ascertaining what source supplies energy to the various stars during the periods of several thousand million years, which represents the average age of the stellar system.&quot;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This University, in collaboration with the Carnegie Institution of Washington, organized the Fourth Conference on Theoretical Physics last month, and some progress was made toward solution of the problem of transmutation of nuclei of stars.</P>
