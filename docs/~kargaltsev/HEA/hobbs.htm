                    <h3>Tribute to Emeritus Professor of Physics Herman H. Hobbs</h3>

<p>Distinguished and Emeritus Professor of Physics, <strong>Herman Hedberg Hobbs</strong>, passed away on Monday, June 13<sup>th</sup>, 2011. He retired in June, 1993, after teaching at GW for forty years.</p>
<p>Professor Hobbs epitomized a professor’s professor: He maintained a deep understanding of his field. He freely shared his wisdom and knowledge. He genuinely cared for the education and welfare of his students.&nbsp; He held a high but achievable standard and encouraged those who wished to develop their own ideas. &nbsp;He could give a highly technical lecture on solid-state physics, and he could generate applause from 400 awe-struck astronomy students; applause for delivering ideas, principles, and examples with startling clarity; applause for his humor and instructive story-telling; applause for his engagement with his audience; applause for unveiling the joy of learning.</p>
<p>Insisting on showing his students the real nature of the universe, Herman avoided artificial art-forms. Instead, he employed 'live' demonstrations and physical instruments to reveal a special property or a general principle. His was a classical pedagogy. Humans deeply respond to direct interaction and long remember the impressions of first-hand experience. Herman skillfully drew from these human traits to impart his subject. Thousands of his past students over a span of 34 years revere Professor Hobbs with a respect born from his careful truth telling and his truthful caring.</p>
<p>Professor Hobbs earned his Bachelor of Science from our University in 1953 and his Doctoral Degree in Physics from the University of Virginia in 1958. He joined our faculty in 1959 as an Associate Professor, and then became Professor and Chairman of the Physics Department in 1960, serving in that capacity for ten years.</p>
<p>Through the years, Professor Hobbs taught over 15,000 students in such diverse fields as quantum physics, solid-state physics, and astronomy. He astounded his colleagues by remembering a good fraction of the names of over 400 students per class he attracted to his astronomy lectures. In 1986, he received the Columbian College Award for Excellence in Teaching. During his career here, he continued active and funded research in the area of metal-whisker crystal growth. In the meantime, his considerable reasoning powers were called upon while serving on the Graduate Council, the Research Committee, on the Faculty Senate (for four terms: 1964-65, 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1974-75), as well as acting as chairman of numerous University committees. His special talks for the Alumni Association have been recognized by two Service Awards and four Certificates of Appreciation.</p>
<p>Professor Hobbs' love of life, learning and do-it-yourself philosophy continued into his retirement, including building a hanger for his airplane, playing classical guitar for his friends, and then taking them to observe the stars and to wonder about the heavens.</p>
