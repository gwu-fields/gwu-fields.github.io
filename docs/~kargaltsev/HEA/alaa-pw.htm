<H4>In November 1996 a NASA satellite called the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer (RXTE) was monitoring a rare type of pulsar some 40 000
light-years from Earth. The star, called SGR 1806-20, is one of just
four known &quot;soft gamma repeaters&quot; -- rotating neutron stars
that periodically emit huge bursts of gamma rays. Now an
international team of astrophysicists studying the RXTE data has
found evidence for what is known as a magnetar -- the most magnetic
object in the universe.</H4>
<H4>Pulsars are rotating neutron stars that appear as giant cosmic
lighthouses. With about one and a half solar masses squeezed into a
sphere with a radius of 10 km, neutron stars are the densest objects
known. The rotation can give rise to a clock-like radio signal, in
which case the star appears as a pulsar. The basic pulsar model
involves a magnetic dipole field tilted with respect to the rotation
axis, beaming radio waves along the dipole axis as the star spins.

<H4><b>Measuring high magnetic fields</b>
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">The electromagnetic emission from a
pulsar comes at the expense of a loss of rotational energy, which
causes its rate of rotation to decrease, or spin down, and enables us
to measure the magnetic field. The spin-down rate is only about a
millionth of a second over 100 years, but it can be measured with
high accuracy in the radio region of the electromagnetic spectrum.
Assuming a simple dipole model, the spin-down rate is proportional to
<I>B<SUP>2</SUP>/P</I>, where <I>P</I> is the star's rotation period
and <I>B</I> is its magnetic field.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">In some cases the magnetic field can
be measured directly, and this is the technique used in the recent
interpretations of the RXTE observations. However, the relationship
between spin-down rate and magneto-dipole losses is not as
straightforward for pulsars that also emit X-rays. But there is a way
round this. In a strong magnetic field, electrons are forced to move
along the field lines, but when magnetic confinement squeezes the
electron in the transverse direction to less than its de Broglie
wavelength then quantum effects become important. The transverse
motion becomes quantized with discrete energy levels &shy; the Landau
levels.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">A direct measure of the star's
magnetic field is therefore obtained by detecting an emission line at
the frequency of electrons making a transition between the Landau
levels. Typically these spectral lines are visible in the hard X-ray
region: for example the electron cyclotron line for the pulsar in the
binary system Hercules X-1 is at about 60 keV.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">Neutron stars are now known to
possess very intense magnetic fields, of the order of 100 million
tesla, which is about six orders of magnitude greater than the
strongest magnetic field in an ordinary star or that can be produced
in a laboratory. But actually explaining the magnetic fields found in
pulsars is a big challenge for theoretical astrophysicists. Ten years
ago Robert Duncan from the University of Texas and Christopher
Thompson from the University of North Carolina showed that during the
formation of a neutron star, convective motions combined with fast
rotation give rise to fields of up to 100 billion tesla. They dubbed
neutron stars with such enormous fields &quot;magnetars&quot;, and
astronomers immediately began to search for them.
</H4>
<H4><B>Hunting magnetars </B>
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">The first magnetar candidates were a
family of rare and peculiar galactic sources of gamma and X-rays
called soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). These slowly rotating pulsars
glow quietly in the X-ray region for several years and then suddenly
become vigorously active for a period of a few weeks to months.
During this phase they emit hundreds of short (~0.1 s) bursts of soft
gamma rays, each with luminosities up to a billion times greater than
that of the Sun. These bursts suggest that SGRs may contain a
magnetar. The theory is that as the magnetar's colossal magnetic
field drifts through the solid crust of the star, it might stress and
sometimes crack the crust to produce what are known as starquakes.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">During a starquake the magnetic field
becomes unstable and abruptly rearranges itself into a state of lower
energy. Violent seismic waves wrinkle the star crust, producing a
displacement in the footprints of the magnetic field. The field lines
can act like stretched strings, generating elastic-type waves called
Alfven waves, which in turn accelerate clouds of particles above the
surface of the star. This is what ultimately produces the gamma-ray
bursts. If this interpretation is correct, then the burst activity of
SGRs is somewhat similar to solar flares, but with a far larger
energy release. In both cases it is the displacement in the
footprints of the magnetic field (due to strong convection in the Sun
and to seismic activity in the neutron star) that triggers the
generation of Alfven waves.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">Magnetars, much as ordinary radio
pulsars, are expected to spin down. However, given that the field
strength of a magnetar is 1000 times greater, the spin-down rate is
now substantial -- about a millisecond per year. In the late 1990s a
team led by Chrissa Kouveliotou of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center and Kevin Hurley of the University of California at Berkeley
succeeded in measuring a spin-down rate in this range for two SGRs.
This was a major breakthrough that greatly strengthened the arguments
in favour of the magnetar scenario for SGRs.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">Despite strong indirect evidence,
however, definite proof of the existence of magnetars was still
missing. Astronomers needed to be able to measure the magnetic field
directly, by detecting the electron cyclotron line. But for a field
of 100 billion tesla, the electron emission energy is a few tens of
MeV -- a region that is spectroscopically inaccessible to current
space missions. However, for such high magnetic fields the proton
cyclotron line, normally hidden in the highly absorbed optical/UV
region, is expected to show up at energies of a few keV.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">Theorists, including Dong Lai and
Winn Ho from Cornell University, along with the present authors,
started to determine the properties of the radiation field. This
field permeates the strongly magnetized plasma under the extreme
conditions that are thought to exist near the surface of a neutron
star. Our aim was to predict the properties of the spectral line,
such as its intensity and width. We concluded that proton cyclotron
lines would appear as absorption features, broad enough to be
resolved using current X-ray observatories. Astronomers thus started
a concerted campaign to search for proton cyclotron features in all
known magnetar candidates. Until now, however, no convincing
detection has been reported from observations of the sources during
their quiescent phase, that is when they are not active.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: medium"><B>Data bursts in</B>
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">The new results are based on
observations from the RXTE satellite of SGR 1806-20 while it was
exhibiting intense bursting behaviour during November 1996. The
satellite is mainly devoted to the study of the time variability of
X-ray sources and it is not equipped with a proper X-ray
spectrograph. However, it does carry a detector called the
Proportional Counter Array (PCA) that can discriminate between
photons with energies from about 2&shy;60 keV. The PCA energy
resolution is not very high (it can distinguish between photons with
energies 20% apart) but this is good enough to produce a plot of the
number of collected photons as a function of their energy.

In 2002 Alaa Ibrahim from The George Washington University, a team from
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, and the present authors, found a
peculiar feature in the X-ray energy spectrum of SGR 1806-20. First
this appeared in a single burst (Ibrahim <I>et al.</I> 2002
arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210513) and then in many other events
(Ibrahim <I>et al.</I> 2002 arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0210515). The
observations led to a direct measurement of the magnetic field,
thereby confirming the magnetar structure of SGRs. In a narrow energy
range centred on 5 keV, the number of photons was less than that
found at other comparable energies (see figure). The energy and width
of this absorption feature are typical of the absorption of
electromagnetic radiation by a proton gyrating in a magnetic field of
about 100 billion tesla.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">The importance of this detection goes
beyond just adding a new entry in the zoo of star characters. It is
the first detection ever of a proton cyclotron feature in a cosmic
source. Moreover, it unequivocally establishes the magnetar nature of
soft gamma repeaters and provides a clear demonstration of the
existence of magnetic fields substantially higher than the quantum
critical value (4.4 billion tesla). This is the value at which the
energy gap between the first and the second Landau level is
comparable to the rest mass of the electron. At this field strength,
the magnetic confinement is so strong that the space available for an
electron in the transverse plane is comparable to its de Broglie
wavelength. This is the smallest spatial region within which an
electron can be localized, and the value of the quantum critical
field therefore has crucial significance as the natural quantum
measure of field strength.
</H4>
<H4 STYLE="font-weight: light">This discovery represents a new
frontier in neutron-star astrophysics. Since magnetars slow down
rapidly, only a handful of them will be active and observable at any
one time. Even so, astronomers expect the number of detections will
increase rapidly in the near future. A conservative estimate puts the
number of magnetars formed in our galaxy at about one million, but
there could equally be between 30 and 100 million. Their detection is
therefore only just beginning.
