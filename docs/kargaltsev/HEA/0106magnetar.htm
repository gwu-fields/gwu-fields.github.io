            a lucky observation, scientists say they have discovered a neutron
            star in the act of changing into a rare class of extremely
            magnetic objects called magnetars. No such event has been
            witnessed definitively until now. This discovery marks only the
            tenth confirmed magnetar ever found and the first transient
            magnetar.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

            neutron star is the core remains of a star at least eight times
            more massive than the Sun that exploded in a supernova event.
            Neutron stars are highly compact, highly magnetic, fast-spinning
            objects with about a Sun's worth of mass compressed into a sphere
            roughly ten miles in diameter.</FONT></FONT></FONT>

            magnetar is up to a thousand times more magnetic than ordinary
            neutron stars. At a hundred trillion (10^14) Gauss, they are so
            magnetic that they could strip a credit card clean at a distance
            of 100,000 miles. The Earth's magnetic field, in comparison, is
            about 0.5 Gauss, and a strong refrigerator magnet is about 100
            Gauss. Magnetars are brighter in X rays than they are in visible
            light, and they are the only stars known that shine predominantly
            by magnetic power.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

            observation presented today supports the theory that some neutron
            stars are born with these ultrahigh magnetic fields, but they may
            be at first too dim to see and measure. In time, however, these
            magnetic fields act to slow the neutron star's spin. This act of
            slowing releases energy, making the star brighter. Additional
            disturbances in the star's magnetic field and crust can make it
            brighter yet, leading to the measurement of its magnetic field.
            The newly discovered star, dim as recent as a year ago, is named
            XTE J1810-197.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

            &quot;The discovery of this source came courtesy of
            another magnetar that we were monitoring, named SGR 1806-20,&quot;
            said Ibrahim. He and his colleagues detected XTE J1810-197 with
            the Rossi Explorer about a degree to the northeast of SGR 1806-20,
            within the Milky Way galaxy about 15,000 light years away in the
            constellation Sagittarius.

            pinpointed the location of the source with NASA's Chandra X-ray
            Observatory, which provides more accurate positioning than Rossi.
            Checking archive data from the Rossi Explorer, Dr. Craig Markwardt
            of NASA Goddard estimated that XTE J1810-197 became active (that
            is, 100 times brighter than before) around January 2003. Looking
            back even further with archived data from ASCA and ROSAT, two
            decommissioned international satellites, the team could spot XTE
            J1810-197 as a very dim, isolated neutron star as early as 1990.
            Thus, the history of XTE J1810-197 emerged.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

            The
            inactive state of XTE J1810-197, Ibrahim said, was similar to that
            of other puzzling objects called Compact Central Objects (CCOs)
            and Dim Isolated Neutron Stars (DINSs). These objects are thought
            to be neutron stars created in the hearts of star explosions, and
            some still reside there, but they are too dim to study in detail.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>One
            mark of a neutron star is its magnetic field. But to measure this,
            scientists need to know the neutron star's spin period and the
            rate that it is slowing down, called the &quot;spin down&quot;.
            When XTE J1810-197 lit up, the team could measure its spin (1
            revolution per 5 seconds, typical of magnetars), its spin down,
            and thus its magnetic field strength (300 trillion Gauss).</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>In
            the alphabet soup of neutron stars, there are also Anomalous X-ray
            Pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray Repeaters (SGRs). Both of these
            are now considered to be the same kind of objects, magnetars; and
            another presentation at today's meeting by Dr. Peter Woods et al.
            supports this connection. These objects periodically but
            unpredictably erupt with X-ray and gamma-ray light. CCOs and DINSs
            appear not to have a similar active state.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Although
            the concept is still speculative, an evolutionary pattern may be
            emerging, Ibrahim said. The same neutron star, endowed with an
            ultrahigh magnetic field, may pass through each of these four
            phases during its lifetime. The proper order, however, remains
            unclear. &quot;Discussion of such a pattern has surfaced in the
            scientific community in recent years, and XTE J1810-197's
            transient nature provides the first tangible evidence in favor of
            such a kinship,&quot; Ibrahim said. &quot;With a few more examples
            of stars showing a similar trend, a magnetar family tree may
            emerge.&quot;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The
            observation implies that magnetars could be more common than what
            is seen but exist in a prolonged dim state,&quot; said team member
            Dr. Jean Swank of NASA Goddard.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
            <P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Magnetars
            seem now to be in a perpetual carnival mode; SGRs are turning into
            AXPs and AXPs can start behaving like SGRs anytime and without
            warning,&quot; said team member Dr. Chryssa Kouveliotou of NASA
            Marshall, who is receiving the Rossi Award at the AAS meeting for
            her work on magnetars. &quot;What started with a few odd sources,
