We are focusing on studying multiwavelength and multimessanger
aspect of various high-energy phenomena occurring in the Universe.  By definition these phenomena must be associated with extreme energy-density environments and huge energy release which occur in the supernova explosions and inside and around compact objects (neutron stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs).  The manifestations of these phenomena typically occur over a broad range of electromagnetic frequencies and require both spectral and temporal analysis to understand their nature. Furthermore, some of these extreme high-energy events are expected to produce  gravitational wave and neutrino signals. As a result members of  our group are actively involved in working with the data from the  word's best observatories which include both space missions (Hubble Space Telescope, <a href="http://chandra.harvard.edu/"> Chandra </a>, <a href="http://xmm.esac.esa.int/"> XMM-Newton </a>, and <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/astroe/astroegof.html"> Suzaku
</a>  X-ray Observatories, <a href="http://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/"> Fermi </a> gamma-ray observatory, <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftsc.html"> Swift </a> multi-wavelength observatory) and
top ground based facilities (<a href="http://www.ligo.caltech.edu/"> Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) </a>, Jansky <a href="http://www.vla.nrao.edu/"> Very Large Array </a>, <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma"> Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) </a>, <a href="http://veritas.sao.arizona.edu/"> VERITAS </a> Cherenkov imaging array).  Our faculty and postdocs design
and carry out observational projects using most of the above observatories.</p>

 <h2>Active Projects include:</h2>

 <ul>

 <li> <font color="#ccffff"><b>Gamma-ray burst (GRB) studies: </b></font>  GRBs  are now known to be extragalactic in origin with an enormous energy release (10<sup>50</sup>-10<sup>54</sup> ergs).
 Historically, most GRBs have been detected as brief (from a few milliseconds to ~1000 seconds) and very intense flares (10<sup>-4</sup>-10<sup>-7</sup>
 erg/s at the Earth) seen in
 gamma-rays and hard X-rays. This corresponds to the frequency range
where most of the burst energy is emitted, although we now understand
that the GRBs are intrinsically multi-wavelength phenomena.
 The first major effort in studying GRBs is associated with the BATSE
mission which detected during its lifetime about 2,700 GRBs in 20-600
keV band.
 However, due to the lack of multi-wavelength capabilities and poor
angular resolution, it was challenging to determine distances to GRBs
solely with BATSE data.
 The slow but steady improvement in ground-based follow-up has finally
established an association between GRBs and remote galaxies.
 Yet the exact physical nature of the GRB phenomenon still remains
elusive. With the launch of modern space telescopes designed to detect
GRBs (such as the Swift and Fermi observatories) the amount
 of information available about individual GRBs virtually exploded.  The
 number of detected GRBs has also grown to ~4,000. Although most GRBs
can be related to the massive object collapse
 or binary merger, there are ongoing debates about the type of object
undergoing collapse/merger (progenitor) and the mechanism responsible
for converting pre-existing gravitational energy to radiation
 (accretion, shocks, reconnection). The total GRB rate is also unknown
because it is surmised that much of the high-energy radiation we receive
 comes from collimated outflows (jets) which happen to
 point at us, but the properties of these jets are still poorly
understood.  GRBs are expected to produce strong gravitational wave and
neutrino signals. GRB studies have far
 reaching implications for cosmological studies and gravitational wave
detection. We are investigating the still mysterious  GRB phenomena
using data Fermi, Swift, VLA, LIGO
 and other observatories. Our group developed a number of novel
techniques  for temporal and spectral GRB analysis.   We also
collaborate with the
 members of the <a href="http://heseweb.nrl.navy.mil/">  high-energy astrophysics group at the Naval Research Laboratory </a>
 (Charles Dermer, Soebur Razzaque).
  The GRB group is led by Prof. Kalvir Dhuga and includes Profs. Leonard
 Maximon, Bill Parke, Bethany Cobb Kung, Alessandra Corsi, and  Oleg
Kargaltsev.<p> <br> </p>


 </li><li> <font color="#ccffff"><b>Supernova and GRB connection: </b></font>
  Since the discovery of an association between long-duration GRBs and
core-collapse supernovae (SNe),
 it has become evident that long GRBs are related to a rare sub-class of
 SNe, which develop highly energetic and collimated relativistic
outflows, likely powered by a central engine (an accreting black hole
 or neutron star). However, it is still a mystery what makes some
core-collapse SNe explode producing an associated relativistic ejecta
(long GRB). The mystery of the GRB-SN connection is tightly linked
  to a question of broad interest in the field of astrophysics, namely,
how do massive stars end their lives. Massive stars, as primary sources
of radiative ionization, heating, and nucleosynthesis products,
  play a crucial role in the evolution of galaxies and the whole
Universe. The mystery of their connection to the most relativistic
explosions of stellar origin (GRBs) is puzzling astronomers all over the
 world.
  Motivated by the key fact that relativistic ejecta in SN explosions
can be probed using radio observations, the astro group at GWU, in an
effort led by Prof. Corsi, is working to unravel the missing
   link between GRBs and SNe using the <a href="http://www.vla.nrao.edu/"> K. Jansky Very Large Array  </a>, in direct collaboration with the
    <a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ptf/"> Palomar Transient Factory </a> team and with <a href="http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/%7Edfrail/"> Dr. D. A. Frail </a> at the <a href="http://www.nrao.edu/">
     National Radio Astronomy Observatory </a>.<p> <br> </p>


 </li><li> <font color="#ccffff"><b> Galactic compact object studies:  </b></font>
 Galactic copmact objects include neutron stars, black holes, and white
dwarfs. Physical processes on these objects result in many facinating
physical
 phenomena such as accretion, relativistic magnetized outflows, shock
waves, particle acceleration, reconnection, various high-energy
radiation processes, etc.  We are studying all of these phenomena as
well as
 the   population
 of Galactic compact objects using multiwavelength observations. Our
current research efforts focus on neutron stars, pulsars and their
nebulae, microquasars and interacting binaries,  galactic TeV sources
and
  strong gravity enviroment in the  black hole vicinity.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"> <i> <b>Neutron stars</b></i> </a> are collapsed stars whose surfaces can be hot  enough to emit radiation in ultraviolet and X-rays.
    In addition many neutron stars manifest themselves as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar"> <b><i>pulsars</i></b> </a>
  - objects that emit short intense bursts of radio waves, x-rays,
    or visible electromagnetic radiation
         at regular intervals. Due to the extreme conditions in the neutron
star interiors, these objects can be used
as natural laboratories for studying the poorly understood properties of
 the superdense,
strongly magnetized, superconducting matter. Such conditions can never
be reproduced in
Earth laboratories and therefore studying neutron stars provides the
only way to learn about
the nuclear reactions and interactions of the elementary particles under
 these extreme conditions. This information is of fundamental importance
 for particle and quantum field physics.
Studying pulsar winds allows one to understand the complicated PWN
morphologies, elucidate the dynamics of relativistic magnetized outflows
 and their interaction with the ambient
medium (e.g., host  <a href="http://www.astro.ufl.edu/%7Eoyk100/SNRs/"> <b><i>Supernova Remnants </i> </b></a>), and learn about particle acceleration in magnetized relativistic plasma. X-ray, gamma-ray, and
optical observations of neutron stars provide valuable diagnostics of all these processes.   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_binary#Microquasar"> <b><i> Microquasars</i> </b> </a> are the most extreme manifestations of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_black_hole"> <b> <i>stellar black holes</i> </b> </a>.
 In these system (which are in many respects analogues to their
supermassive counterparts in active galactic nuclei)
  matter pulled from a massive companion star falls into a black hole or
 onto a neutron star. In this proccess  the matter heats up to very high
 temperatures and emits intense X-ray radiation.
  Due to the rapid rotation of the compact object s fraction of
infalling matter is being ejected from the system along the compact
object spin axis leading to formation of <b> <i> jets </i> </b>
  whose nonthermal emission can be seen througout  a wide range of
frequencies.  Some microquasars are also emit very high energy (VHE)
radiation in GeV and TeV bands. The  exact mechanism responsible for the
 VHE radiation is has not yet been established with several
  possibilitites being currently explored.  You can learn more about the
 compact object studies at GWU <a href="http://home.gwu.edu/%7Ekargaltsev/HEA/HEA_Compact_Objects.html"> here </a>. The compact object studies are led
  by Prof. Kargaltsev with participation of other faculty postdocs and students. We also collaborate closely with the <a href="http://www.astro.psu.edu/astro-research/areas-of-research/neutron-stars"> Neutron Star group </a> at the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at Penn State  University. <p> <br> </p>

  </li><li> <font color="#ccffff"><b> Using automated algorithms for astrophysical object classification:  </b></font>   We are applying intellegent machine-learning classification algorithms  to determine the nature of thousands of X-ray sources
  and GRBs. This effort is led by Prof. Kargaltsev with participation of several other faculty and students.  <p> <br> </p>

  </li><li> <font color="#ccffff"><b> Gravitational wave search and detection:  </b></font>
  Gravitational waves (GWs) offer a remarkable opportunity to open a
totally new view of the Universe, providing the chance to solve
mysterious questions on some of the most fascinating astrophysical
sources.
  &nbsp;Gravitational waves, for example, could probe \textit{for the
first time directly}, the nature of GRB progenitors. Indeed, being
related to catastrophic events involving stellar-mass objects,
   gamma-ray bursts are good&nbsp;candidates for the detection of
gravitational waves. Ground-based gravitational wave detectors like the
Laser&nbsp;Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (<a href="http://www.ligo.org/" www.ligo.org"=""> LIGO </a>
and <a href="http://home.gwu.edu/%7Ekargaltsev/HEA/www.virgo.infn.it"> Virgo </a>),
 have been carrying out GRB-triggered searches for gravitational waves
during the last decade. Starting from 2016, with the advent of the
  <a href="https://www.advancedligo.mit.edu/"> advanced LIGO </a>, a
totally new view of these sources is likely to be opened. Motivated by
these exciting prospects, our GW group (led by Dr. Corsi at GWU)
  is working on the study of GRBs as gravitational wave sources, and
more generally on joint electromagnetic and gravitational wave studies
of transient astrophysical sources. This effort is led by Prof. Corsi,
  and sees the participation of several GWU students. Data analysis
investigations are developed within the <a href="http://home.gwu.edu/%7Ekargaltsev/HEA/www.ligo.org"> LIGO Scientific Collaboration </a>.
   Source modeling and related phenomenological studies include collaborations with <a href="http://www2.astro.psu.edu/users/nnp/gw.html"> Prof. P. Meszaros </a>  and  <a href="http://gravity.psu.edu/%7Eowen/"> Prof. B. J. Owen </a> at Penn State University.

 </li><li> <font color="#ccffff"><b> Cataclysmic Variable studies: </b></font>
 Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are close-binary star systems which undergo systematic brightenings ('novae').  Evidence indicates that CVs are undergoing mass transfer from a 'doner star' to a white dwarf due
 to gravitational tidal forces from the white dwarf acting on the doner star (such as a nearby red giant).  The material from the doner star forms an accretion disk, made largely of hydrogen, around the white dwarf.  As this hot material in the accretion disk radiates and falls onto the surface the white dwarf, it accumulates until it reaches a sufficient temperature and density to undergo a thermonuclear reaction,
 producing a novae.  This process can repeat many times, although residual accumulated helium may
 bring the white dwarf to critical mass.
 Because of the quasi-stochastic nature of the light from CV outbursts, CVs can be a test bed
 for the study of such light from explosive events, such as GRBs.  Data from the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/" alt="kepler">Kepler mission</a>, with fine time resolution, is now available.
