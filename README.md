Creating a static website using Github Pages
There are two generators "Jekyll" and "Github Actions".  While both work, the "Jekyll" engine had problems with files/folders with a leading "~".

The github action is configured to make the contents of the /docs folder the root of the website.
Other files can be stored beside that doc folder and remain unpublished.
