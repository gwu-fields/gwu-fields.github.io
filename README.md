This repo is for the hosting of gwu-fields.github.io
In repo Settings, under pages, you can choose which branch and if the root is the "root of the repo" or "/docs".  I created an "other" file to test if other folders would become an option.
Currently, I chose "/docs".

I also have discoveder that "~" is not a valid character for a folder name (at least the beginning character) which would have allowed us to completely replace home/acad.
