</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Niels Bohr, world famous Danish physicist, is attending the third Washington Conference in Theoretical Physics, which began yesterday and will continue through Saturday.  It is held under the auspices of the Carnegie Institution and the University, the work of which is under the direction of Dr. George Gamow and Dr. Edward Teller, professors of theoretical physics.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dr. Bohr, outstanding in the realm of modern physics, is director of the University Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, Denmark.  He is known for the development of the quantum theory which supplants Newton’s mechanics theory, as concerns radiation of the atom.  In 1922 he was awarded the Nobel prize for his work in physics.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Further development of these ideas show that a precise determination of the orbit of an electron around the nucleus of the atom is impossible, and that it is even meaningless to give such a description of the interior of the atom.  In these experiments, laws of probability have to be used instead, to describe completely the physical and chemical behavior of the atom as far as any experiment on this subject can go.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both Dr. Gamow and Dr. Teller were associated with Bohr before they came to this country and these scientists are renowned for discoveries in their fields.  Under their leadership experiments are being conducted at the University, while Dr. M.A. Tuve, Dr. L.R. Hafsted, and Dr. George Breit, Jr., headed work of this field in the Carnegie Institution.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the week two formal sessions are being held, one Monday at the University and the second Wednesday at the Carnegie Institution.  The remainder of the meeting will consist of informal conferences among the small group of scientists who have been invited to attend.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The subject of the Third Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics will be &quot;Problems of Elementary Particles.&quot;  Dr. Bohr will be accompanied to Washington by his research associate, Dr. Kalckar, and both scientists upon leaving here will continue to Japan.</P>
